###### Notes :
- It is advised to use [DPE-gen-9](https://github.com/Shiny-Miner/Dynamic-Pokemon-Expansion-Gen-9) with it.
- If you want to see how potential this expansion would have in future read [this](https://github.com/Shiny-Miner/CFRU-expansion/blob/Experiments/todo.md)
- Please don't try to use leon rombase on it as it already contains items + more
- Added convienience for compiling, now run a_makepy.bat to make the project (it executes "python scripts//make.py") and run b_cleanpy.bat to clean repo (it runs python scripts//clean.py)
- Do not talk to Fat guy and Lady in pallet town unless if you're trying to test following pokemon code.
- The Mid battle evolutions work almost fine but there is a slight error for bulbasaur evolving to ivysaur:
Going to fight button messes the graphics (it only fixes when you switch pokemon in battle, happens only for bulbasaur)
